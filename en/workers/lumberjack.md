The Lumberjack is a very essential worker. He will harvest trees to provide the wood for all your Town needs. He will look for nearby trees and chop them down. He will also plant a sapling in it's place again of the same variety he just chopped down (provided that the tree dropped saplings and/or you provide him with the appropriate saplings). He will only plant a sapling AFTER chopping down a tree, if there are no trees nearby, he will NOT plant any saplings to create a tree.
 
Before you choose a place to build his hut, take into account that he has to be near trees or that you personally will have to plant trees close to his hut so he can work. After you have selected a place for the hut you have to craft the Lumberjack's Hut block in the crafting table and use your [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwpv_c6Pbvg Buiding Tool] to place the building. Once you "commit" to the placement of the Lumberjack's Hut, the block will be placed and the Lumberjack will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best "[[Workers#Traits|Traits]]" for Lumberjack if you changed this in the setting tab in the [[Town Hall|Town Hall's GUI]]. 

Best Traits are: Strength and Charisma.

You now officially have a "Lumberjack!" CONGRATULATIONS!

Now you can give the Lumberjack an axe and he/she will start to look for trees to chop down right away. You will have to issue the builder the "Build" assignment so he can build the "Lumberjack's Hut". He will be asking for the materials he/she needs. Make sure to check the "chat" section of Minecraft regularly to see what materials the builder is requesting for any build/upgrade. 

Once the builder is done, you can think about upgrading the Lumberjackâ€™s hut to expand the range at which he/she looks for trees. 

*'''Hint:''' If you see the builder has not finished building/upgrading your Lumberjack's hut and you don't see the builder asking for any materials, go to the builder's hut and "recall' the builder and wait a bit to see what the builder needs. Watch the Minecraft "chat" section. Also you can go to page 2 of the builder's hut GUI and check the list of materials required, any material in the list that is still missing will be in red colored letters. 

Now you can access the Lumberjack's Hut block (right click on it) and you will see a GUI with different options:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| valign="top" | The Worker assigned and his/her Level. (the Worker levels up in time by doing his/her work. The higher the level the faster and more efficient he/she will be). And the buttons: 
*Fire/Hire Worker.- If you think you have a better Citizen for the job with better skills or "Traits"
*Recall Worker.- If the builder gets stuck somewhere, or you just want to see what the builder has or give the builder something directly.
*Build/Upgrade Building.- to create the build/upgrade work order for this building.
*Repair Building.- So the builder can recreate the original building (at the current level) and fix any broken, missing, unwanted addons to the original building.
*Inventory.- This is the most important button. Here you can access the buildings storage from where the "Worker" takes and deposits materials, tools and anything he/she finds along the way (citizens will pickup anything in their path that is considered a "drop" saplings, seeds, rotten flesh, bones, arrows, etc.).

*'''Hint:''' You can give the Lumberjack an enchanted axe and reap the benefits of the speed he will be chopping down trees for your Town's needs. Also you can remove any trees/saplings and replant any type of sapling in any pattern or shape you need to create your perfect grove, for easier access and less walking around, which means more chop chop... ;p
