# Recipes

<<<<<<< Updated upstream:tutorials/recipes.md
> supplyship
=======
Listed in this page are the current crafting recipes available in this mod. This will be updated as any craftable blocks are added and made public in the mod.

**Notes**  
The building tool used in any of these recipes will not be consumed in the recipe, it is simply to seperate our recipes from possible conflicting recipes in other mods.

## Hut Blocks

**Notes**  
The town hall is not listed here as it does not have a crafting recipe, this is intentional as it is given in a chest that spawns with the Supply Ship/Camp.
