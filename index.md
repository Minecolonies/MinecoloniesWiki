# Welcome to the MineColonies Wiki!

MineColonies is an interactive building mod that allows you to create your own thriving town within Minecraft. It allows your leadership skills to soar by providing you with everything you need to build your own personal kingdom. MineColonies gives you the flexibility to create a colony as rich and unique as every player. With so many options you'll build a different colony every time, adapt it to any biome and terrain, build inside a mountain, on top of it, under the ocean or in the sky.

The limit is your imagination!

Featuring NPC workers such as [Builders](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/builder), [Farmers](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/farmer), [Fishers](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/fisher), [Lumberjacks](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/lumberjack), [Guards](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/guard), [Miners](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/miner), [Smelters](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/smelter), [Bakers](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/baker), [Cooks](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/cook), [Couriers](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/courier), four types of animal herders, [Composters](../../MinecoloniesWiki/source/workers/composter), and many more, with even more being developed and added as the mod grows.
