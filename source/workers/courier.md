The Courier is a critial part of the bloodline of your colony. They will run from worker's hut to [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) to worker's hut, visiting all your workers and delivering the tools and materials they need as well as taking their production to the Warehouse.

The level of the Courier's Hut will dictate how much materials/tools the Courier can carry to/from Huts - Warehouse - Huts, so if you want them to carry more materials/tools, upgrade the Courier's Hut. Also, the higher the level of the hut, the faster the Courier will run.

| Courier's Hut Level | Max Stacks Carried |
| :---------------------: | :----------------: |
| 1                       | 1                  |
| 2                       | 2                  |
| 3                       | 4                  |
| 4                       | 5                  |
| 5                       | unlimited          |

### Note: You MUST build the Warehouse to at least level 1 so the Courier can do their work.

### Note: You can have up to 10 Couriers per Warehouse. The default configuration only allows for 1 Warehouse, but this can be changed. However, Couriers assigned to subsequent Warehouses will only see the items in the Warehouse they are assigned to.
