Guards are the protecting force for your colony. As long as you provide a Guard with a weapon, they will protect your colony day and night. 

There are two types of Guards: Knights and Archers. Knights use swords, while Archers use bows. (Archers don't require arrows to shoot.) You can set the type of Guard in the [Guard Tower](../../source/buildings/guardtower) or [Barracks Tower](../../source/buildings/barrackstower) GUI.

Guards will use armor when provided with some, and (if they're a Knight) will use a shield as well.
