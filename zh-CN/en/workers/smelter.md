# Smelter

The Smelter is an essential worker to add after your town is established.

*For example, once you have a warehouse, and your miner is happily digging ores and coal below the surface.*

Once completed, the smelter worker will take any smeltable ores; such as Iron, Gold, Coal, (or even Tinker's Ores!), as well as a fuel source and happily smelt them into ingots for you!

Ideal Worker Characteristics: Primary & Secondary

**Ideal placement:** Anywhere within the colony.

The Deliveryman, or the player, will deliver ore and fuel to the smeltery worker. *As a side note, at this point in time, the workers who use furnaces will use **ANY** burnable item which can be used as a fuel.
